# PREDICTIVE-ANALYSIS_FOR_HEART_DISEASE
Notes on process of creating my model to prevent and predict Heart Disease!  


First Dataset:
	The accuracy is relatively low at about 58.9%. This might not be sufficient depending on the requirements of your task.
	The classification report shows very poor performance for some classes (1, 2, 4) with no predictions correctly made for class 1 and 4.
	This suggests that the model might be struggling with a class imbalance, or these classes are not well-represented or separable with the chosen features and model.


Second Dataset:
	The accuracy is considerably better at 79%.
	The precision, recall, and F1-scores are much higher, indicating a better performing model on this dataset.
	The confusion matrix shows some misclassifications, particularly for the second class where only about 56% of the cases were correctly identified.

Second dataset is much more relaible to be used to predict heart disease.
